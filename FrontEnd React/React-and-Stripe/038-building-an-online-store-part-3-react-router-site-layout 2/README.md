# Building an CLIENT SIDE Online Store using React, Stripe, and the React Hooks API

## Episode 38 - Part 3 - Implementing React Router and a Site Layout

Today we continue the series by wiring up React Router v4, creating a site layout for a common layout and styling, a top bar for our logo/site name and for the section links like products and view cart, and adding the cart item count to the top bar view cart link!

This is part 3 of the series and will be continued!
